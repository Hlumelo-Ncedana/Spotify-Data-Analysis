Spotify Streaming Data Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes streaming data from Spotify to explore user behavior, music preferences, and trends. The dataset contains detailed information about the tracks played by users, including the track name, artist, album, play duration, platform, and more. The analysis aims to uncover insights into track popularity, platform usage, and patterns such as shuffle mode and skipped tracks.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
Field	Description
spotify_track_uri	Spotify URI that uniquely identifies each track in the form of "spotify:track:<base-62 string>"
ts	Timestamp indicating when the track stopped playing in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
platform	Platform used when streaming the track
ms_played	Number of milliseconds the stream was played
track_name	Name of the track
artist_name	Name of the artist
album_name	Name of the album
reason_start	Why the track started
reason_end	Why the track ended
shuffle	TRUE or FALSE depending on if shuffle mode was used when playing the track
skipped	TRUE or FALSE depending on if the user skipped to the next song
Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

Track popularity: Identify the most popular tracks based on play duration.
Platform analysis: Understand which platforms are being used the most for streaming.
User behavior: Analyze patterns in shuffle mode usage and tracks being skipped.
Time-based trends: Analyze how user behavior changes over time (e.g., day of the week, time of day).

Methodology

The analysis was performed using Python with the following tools:

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: For an interactive environment to explore the data and visualize insights.

Key steps in the analysis include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, converting timestamps, etc.).
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Time-based analysis to understand user behavior over different periods.
Visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and time-series plots to present the results.

Key Findings
Top Tracks: The most played tracks were identified, with the total play duration ranked by track.
Platform Usage: We found that the most popular platform for streaming was Andriod.
Shuffle Mode: A significant percentage of users preferred shuffle mode, with 66% of tracks played on shuffle.
Time - based trend: Year 2016 to 2018, were years with the most streams.


Future Work

Prediction models: Build machine learning models to predict user preferences or song recommendations.
Real-time data streaming: Integrate the analysis with live data from Spotify's API.
Deep dive into user demographics: Analyze user behavior based on demographic data (e.g., location, age group).
